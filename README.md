## Overview

In many richly detailed fantasy worlds, especially darker ones, racial interactions are far from simple. This tool serves as a quick reference companion for Game Masters and potentially players to understand the ingrained prejudices, historical conflicts, wary tolerances, and systemic oppression defining the social landscape. It provides both specific relationship details and a high-level visual overview based on the established lore for this setting.

## Features

*   **Interactive Dropdowns:** Select any two distinct races to instantly view the specific relationship dynamic from the first race's perspective towards the second.
*   **Detailed Descriptions:** Access concise explanations outlining the historical context, core reasons (fear, disdain, exploitation, grudging respect, etc.), and typical interactions between the selected races.
*   **Sidebar Overview:** Click on any race in the sidebar list to get an immediate visual representation of that race's general disposition towards all other races.
*   **Color-Coded Relationships:** The sidebar uses intuitive color coding:
    *   **Red:** Hostile / Suppressive / Deep Distrust
    *   **Grey:** Neutral / Wary / Indifferent / Pragmatically Suspicious
    *   **Green:** Tolerant / Pragmatic Acceptance / Alliance of Necessity (Closest to "friendly" in this setting)
*   **Setting-Specific:** Tailored to the unique racial dynamics established for this particular dark fantasy campaign world.

## How to Use

There are two primary ways to interact with the tool:

1.  **Specific Relationship Lookup:**
    *   Use the first dropdown menu (`Select Race A`) to choose the originating race.
    *   Use the second dropdown menu (`Select Race B`) to choose the target race.
    *   Read the detailed description in the box below, which explains how Race A views and typically interacts with Race B.

2.  **General Disposition Overview:**
    *   Click on any race name listed in the sidebar on the left.
    *   The clicked race will be highlighted (blue).
    *   Observe the background colors of the *other* races in the sidebar to quickly grasp the selected race's general attitude towards them (Red = Hostile, Grey = Neutral/Wary, Green = Tolerant/Pragmatic).

## Technology Stack

This tool is built entirely with front-end web technologies:

*   HTML5
*   CSS3
*   Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)

No server-side processing or external libraries are required.

## Motivation

This project was created as a worldbuilding aid to help maintain consistency and quickly reference the complex social fabric of a custom dark fantasy TTRPG setting. It aims to make navigating the established racial tensions easier during gameplay and preparation.
